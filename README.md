# Limestone

CLI app for downloading music from Slav Art on [Divolt](https://divolt.xyz).

## Building

Install Go through your system's package manager or from [the download page](https://go.dev/dl/).
Alternatively, I recommend using [go-installer](https://github.com/kerolloz/go-installer).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dxbednarczyk/limestone
$ cd limestone
$ go get && go build
```
